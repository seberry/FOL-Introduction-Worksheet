
This is a version of some practice problems associated with lecture notes for my intermediate logic class. 


## Modal Logic Playground

This worksheet embeds and slightly modifies the
[Modal Logic Playground](https://github.com/rkirsling/modallogic) by
Ross Kirsling, used under the MIT License (see `modallogic/LICENSE`).

My changes:
- switched propositional variable labels to uppercase (P, Q, …)
- small keybinding/focus tweaks to make the playground work well
  inside an iframe-based worksheet.
